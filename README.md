# SheetsPersist
Simple Object Persistence and Logging to Google Sheets

SheetsPersist gives you two ways to integrate .NET object instances with Google Sheets.

1. Object Persistence (read and write object instances to/from a spreadsheet).
2. Logging (send .NET instances to a rich log kept in a spreadsheet).
